# 🧠 AgentForge – Business Plan & Product Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision
AgentForge is a dark, futuristic Agent-as-a-Service marketplace built on Solana, where users can mint, upgrade, and run fully autonomous agents. These agents handle complex tasks like DeFi automation, AI assistance, NFT trading, and more—without users needing to know code. The goal is to create a modular agent economy powered by the $FORGE token.

Start with 1 agent:  
> 🔍 "Smart Research Assistant" (powered by OpenAI)

- Users input a topic or prompt
- Agent returns research results, summarized insights, or generated ideas
- Example use: "Give me 3 profitable NFT projects under 1 SOL."

📌 This agent showcases AI power, is useful to all Web3 users, and has viral potential.  
More agent types (trading bot, NFT flipper, content writer) will follow in future updates.
